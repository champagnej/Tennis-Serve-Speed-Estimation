% When the 
% Use physics
% Obey standard motion equations
% Use quadratic extrapolation - Find exact physical equation
% Get the error for each data point
% If error is high - Either hit the ground or change in direction

% Run prediction algorithm twice
% Forward and backwards (Intersection)


% Make sure the time spring semester ends, have an appropiate product


% Gather enough clips to have a ground truth

% Use number of frames to determine speed (Kinematic equations)



% End of the spring semester, compare one with the other
